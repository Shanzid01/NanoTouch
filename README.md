# NanoTouch

<a href="http://slideme.org/application/nanotouch">Download app (Android)</a>

NanoTouch is an app which will help you use all the toggles you need in no time. It has been primarily based on "Assistive Touch" on Apple devices. Once you press the "Activate" option it launches a panel from which you can access all the toggles.

With NanoTouch you can:<br>
• Easily switch on/off Wifi, Bluetooth, Mobile Data, Auto-Sync and a whole lot more.<br>
• Adjust screen brightness and set sound volumes.<br>
• Add apps to Favorites to have access to them anytime without having to open the App Drawer.<br>
• Set Change Persistence(from "Settings") to the specific toggles to make sure that other apps cannot change the toggle state once you have changed it.<br>

Adjust the look of the panel to your own preferences from the "Settings" option.

<b>Note: The source code has been extracted from the apk (JADX decompiler). This is a very old project and I have since lost the original code.</b><br>
